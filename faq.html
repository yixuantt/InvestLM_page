            <p><strong>How accurate are the results?</strong><br>
            While we have implemented guardrails, users should be aware that responses are generated by AI and may sometimes be incorrect or inappropriate.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I use this platform for real-time tasks?</strong><br>
            No, it does not have access to real-time data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Does the platform support API integration?</strong><br>
            Not currently. However, we plan to provide API access in the future to enable more programmatic use.</p>

            4. Account Registration
        </button>
        <div id="registration" class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>What is your definition of a local financial institution?</strong><br>
            We define a local financial institution based on the information provided during registration, such as company name, industry type, address, and website. This helps us determine if a registrant belongs to the target user group.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why can you not open the service to all registrants who are local financial institutions? How many user accounts are available?</strong><br>
            Due to limited computing resources, the platform’s response speed depends on factors like concurrent users and network traffic. To ensure a good user experience, we are rolling out access in phases. Initially, a limited number of user accounts will be available, with potential expansion based on demand.</p>
            
            <p><strong>If registrations exceed available accounts, how will you select successful registrations?</strong><br>
            Our goal is to support local financial institutions, with a focus on small- to medium-sized firms. Selection will be based on factors such as industry type and limiting multiple registrations from the same institution to ensure fair access.</p>
            
            <p><strong>When will applicants know the results of their registration after submitting the registration form online?</strong><br>
            We will try to get back to you within one week.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How can we contact the InvestLM team for suggestions and inquiries?</strong><br>
            For suggestions or inquiries regarding this platform, please contact the InvestLM research team at <a href="mailto:investlm@ust.hk">investlm@ust.hk</a>.</p>
